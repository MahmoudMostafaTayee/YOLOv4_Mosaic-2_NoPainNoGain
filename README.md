# YoloV4
This repository is for using the official YOLO-v4 implementation to identify people with mask vs. without mask, this work is done in the cloud using colab with GPU enabled.

YOLO stands for you only look once which is an object detection model based on deep learning.\
YOLO-v4 is targeting the creation of a CNN that operates in real-time on a conventional GPU, and for which
training requires only one conventional GPU.\

The following figure shows a comparison of the proposed YOLOv4 and other state-of-the-art object detectors.
